# Foundational Ontologies for RAG

<SummaryBox>

**Foundational ontologies provide top-level categories and constraints for domain ontologies. Three major options: DOLCE, BFO, and SUMO.**

**DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering):**
- Cognitive/descriptive approach
- Endurants vs. perdurants distinction
- Best for: AI/NLP applications

**BFO (Basic Formal Ontology):**
- Realist/scientific approach
- Continuants vs. occurrents (similar to endurants/perdurants)
- Best for: Scientific/biomedical domains

**SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology):**
- Comprehensive, includes processes, objects, abstract entities
- IEEE standard
- Best for: General-purpose reasoning

**Why choose one:** Provides shared vocabulary, formal constraints, and interoperability with other ontologies in the same foundation.

</SummaryBox>

## Why Anchor to a Foundation?

The <CrossReference slug="04-rag-ontology/rag-ontology-map" /> maps RAG concepts to DOLCE categories. But DOLCE is not the only foundational ontology. **BFO** and **SUMO** offer different categorization schemes — and the choice affects how you model, reason about, and extend the RAG ontology.

A foundational ontology provides:
- **Shared vocabulary** for cross-domain interoperability
- **Formal constraints** that prevent modeling errors
- **Philosophical grounding** that distinguishes types from roles, things from processes

## The Three Major Foundational Ontologies

### DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering)

Developed at the Laboratory for Applied Ontology (LOA-CNR, Italy). DOLCE is **cognitively oriented** — it models the categories underlying human language and thought.

<DiagramBlock caption="DOLCE top-level categories relevant to RAG" label="DOLCE hierarchy">
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P["Particular"] --> E["Endurant"]
    P --> PD["Perdurant"]
    P --> Q["Quality"]
    P --> A["Abstract"]

    E --> PE["Physical Endurant"]
    E --> NPE["Non-Physical Endurant"]

    NPE --> NPO["Non-Physical Object"]
    NPO --> Concept["Concept"]
    NPO --> RoleD["Role"]
    NPO --> Art["Artefact"]

    PD --> Stative["Stative"]
    PD --> Eventive["Eventive"]

    Stative --> State["State"]
    Stative --> Process["Process"]

    Eventive --> Achievement["Achievement"]
    Eventive --> Accomplishment["Accomplishment"]
```
</DiagramBlock>

**Key strengths for RAG**:
- Rich **non-physical endurant** hierarchy — documents and chunks are information artefacts, naturally modeled as non-physical objects
- **Role** as a first-class category — Retriever, Generator, and Indexer are roles played by components, not essential types
- Four-way **process taxonomy** (State, Process, Achievement, Accomplishment) — captures the difference between ongoing retrieval and completed query sessions

### BFO (Basic Formal Ontology)

Developed by Barry Smith. BFO is **realist and minimal** (only 34 terms). It's an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 21838-2) and the backbone of the OBO Foundry biomedical ontologies.

<DiagramBlock caption="BFO top-level categories relevant to RAG" label="BFO hierarchy">
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E["Entity"] --> C["Continuant"]
    E --> O["Occurrent"]

    C --> IC["Independent Continuant"]
    C --> SDC["Specifically Dependent Continuant"]

    IC --> ME["Material Entity"]
    IC --> IE["Immaterial Entity"]

    SDC --> Qual["Quality"]
    SDC --> RE["Realizable Entity"]

    RE --> RoleBFO["Role"]
    RE --> Disp["Disposition"]
    RE --> Func["Function"]

    O --> Proc["Process"]
    O --> PB["Process Boundary"]
    O --> TR["Temporal Region"]
```
</DiagramBlock>

**Key strengths for RAG**:
- **Realizable Entity** hierarchy distinguishes Role, Disposition, and Function — a Retriever's *function* (what it's designed for), *disposition* (capacity to retrieve), and *role* (context-dependent status) are all distinct concepts
- Minimal and rigorous — forces you to justify every category
- ISO standard with strong tooling ecosystem

### SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology)

Developed by Adam Pease et al. SUMO is **larger and more expressive** than DOLCE or BFO, with rich axioms in first-order logic and links to WordNet.

**Key strengths for RAG**:
- **InformationBearingObject** hierarchy cleanly separates content (information) from medium (storage)
- **IntentionalProcess** captures that RAG generation is purposeful, not random
- **Communication** models the query-response pattern as a communicative act

## Same Concept, Different Categorizations

How does "Retrieval" look in each framework?

<DiagramBlock caption="Retrieval mapped across three foundational ontologies" label="Retrieval across ontologies">
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph DOLCE
        direction TB
        D1["Particular"] --> D2["Perdurant"]
        D2 --> D3["Stative"]
        D3 --> D4["Process"]
        D4 --> D5["Retrieval"]
    end

    subgraph BFO
        direction TB
        B1["Entity"] --> B2["Occurrent"]
        B2 --> B3["Process"]
        B3 --> B4["Retrieval"]
    end

    subgraph SUMO
        direction TB
        S1["Entity"] --> S2["Process"]
        S2 --> S3["IntentionalProcess"]
        S3 --> S4["Retrieval"]
    end
```
</DiagramBlock>

| Aspect | DOLCE | BFO | SUMO |
|--------|-------|-----|------|
| Category for Retrieval | Stative Process | Occurrent Process | IntentionalProcess |
| What it captures | Ongoing, cumulative activity | Something with temporal parts | Purposeful computational action |
| Distinction from QuerySession | Process vs Accomplishment (cumulative vs telic) | Process vs Process (less fine-grained) | Process vs Process (distinguished by axioms) |

DOLCE's four-way perdurant distinction is the most expressive here — it captures that Retrieval is cumulative (two retrievals composed = still retrieval) while QuerySession is an accomplishment (it has a natural endpoint).

## How "Document" Maps Differently

| Aspect | DOLCE | BFO | SUMO |
|--------|-------|-----|------|
| Category | Non-physical Artefact | Generically Dependent Continuant | InformationBearingObject |
| Key insight | A designed information object | Exists by virtue of being concretized in a medium | Content separable from medium |
| Implication | Focus on document as cultural/social artefact | Focus on document's dependence on physical storage | Focus on information content vs physical carrier |

## Which Foundation for RAG?

<PathNotTaken title="Building a RAG ontology without any foundational ontology" reason="Without a foundation, you lack formal constraints on your categories. You might accidentally make 'RetrievedChunk' a subclass of 'DocumentChunk' (violating rigidity constraints), or model 'Retrieval' as an entity instead of a process. Foundational ontologies prevent these structural errors." />

**Our recommendation: DOLCE** for RAG ontology design, because:

1. **Information objects are first-class citizens** — documents, chunks, and embeddings are non-physical artefacts, which DOLCE models natively
2. **Rich process taxonomy** — the State/Process/Achievement/Accomplishment distinction maps perfectly to RAG's mix of ongoing processes and discrete events
3. **Role as a formal category** — Retriever, Generator, Indexer as roles (not types) is naturally expressed in DOLCE
4. **Cognitive alignment** — since RAG is ultimately about human-AI interaction, DOLCE's cognitive orientation is appropriate

**When to consider BFO instead**: If your RAG system is part of a scientific data pipeline (e.g., biomedical literature retrieval) and needs to interoperate with OBO Foundry ontologies.

**When to consider SUMO instead**: If you need extremely detailed axioms for automated reasoning, or if your RAG system processes multi-modal content where the content/medium distinction matters.

## Bringing It All Together

The journey through this section:

1. <CrossReference slug="04-rag-ontology/ontology" /> introduced endurants and perdurants
2. <CrossReference slug="04-rag-ontology/competency-questions" /> showed how to ask the right questions
3. <CrossReference slug="04-rag-ontology/rag-ontology-map" /> derived the complete RAG ontology from those questions
4. This page compared which foundational ontology best anchors that derivation

The ontology is not just an academic exercise — it provides the formal structure that <CrossReference slug="03-graph-rag/graphrag" /> uses when extracting entities and relationships from documents.

## What's Next

With the full ontological picture in hand, move to <CrossReference slug="05-synthesis/progressive-map" /> for a visual synthesis of everything we've covered — from naive RAG through graph-based approaches to ontological engineering.
